# Host Filter List to UBlock Origin Filter List
A (relatively) useful html website for converting host filters (e.g., `0.0.0.0 subdomain.adserver.com` or  `127.0.0.1 subdomain.adserver.com`) to uBlock Origin custom filters (e.g., `||subdomain.domain.com^`)

I made this so I could convert a stupid spotify ad filter list [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/x0uid/SpotifyAdBlock/master/hosts) that you can use to test the tool if you want

this is very barebones and I didn't spend much time making style look good or anything, it's just supposed to be single use and functional so I guess it works...

I was pretty bored and I got pissed off at spotify so I release dis with a ui thing instead of making it just parse text file which isnt user friendly...
